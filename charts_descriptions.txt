Bar Charts
The workhorse of charts. Effective at showing the change of a quantity over a small number of regular time intervals, or at comparing several different quantities against each other.
Line Charts
More effective than bar charts when there is a large number of data values to show, or for showing quantities that vary on an irregular schedule.
Pie Charts
Often overused but can be effective to highlight the proportion of a single value within a whole.
Scatter Charts
Effective for showing possible relationships between two values.
Bubble Charts
Adds a third value to scatter charts, but should be used carefully, as humans have difficulty accurately assessing the relative areas of circular regions.
Radar Charts
Designed to show several aspects of the subject on one chart. Not as familiar to many users, but can be effective for certain specialized cases.
